# üçπMake Me a Mocktail - Mocktail Recommender App
This mocktail recommender provides you with a list of mocktails that you can make with the chosen ingredients, along with instructions and images as well as missing ingredients (maximum of two missing ingredients), saved in a doc file named mocktail.docx which would be saved in the directory where you have saved this project.

The motivation behind this project is to provide you with a beverage option outside of your usual coke or pepsi, according to what you have in your kitchen.
==**Note - For all recipes it is assumed that you have water and ice available.**==
