## General Information
For people who consume soft drinks, the usual coke and pepsi have become extremely boring and monotnous. This app provides a variety of options for anyone looking to drink something new, outside of the soft drink market.
This mocktail recommender provides you with a list of mocktails that you can make with the chosen ingredients, along with instructions and images as well as missing ingredients sorted in ascending order of missing ingredients (maximum of 2 missing ingredients), saved in a doc file named **mocktail.docx** which would be saved in the directory where you have saved this project.

The motivation behind this project is to provide you with a beverage option outside of your usual coke or pepsi, according to what you have in your kitchen.
**Note - For all recipes it is assumed that you have water and ice available.**

You simply have to run `main.py` , select your ingredients and click on ok.
